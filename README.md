This is a simple math game app where users solve multiplication problems against a countdown timer. 
The game generates random multiplication tasks, and users input their answers using on-screen buttons. 
The game tracks the score and high score, with the difficulty increasing as the score improves. 
If time runs out or the user inputs an incorrect answer, the game ends, displaying the final score and allowing the user to restart.
